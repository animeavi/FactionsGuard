# FactionsGuard
This Spigot plugin offers some additional protections for Factions that may be of interest depending on what you want for your server.

The protections include:
* Disabling TNT explosions inside of Faction claim.

  This is to protect against TNT cannons. Unfortunately the way this had to be done means nobody can use TNTs to blow up terrain in any land claimed by any faction, even your own.

* Preventing Chorus Fruit and Ender Pearl teleport inside of the land of any faction you don't belong to.
* Prevents animals from being hurt by people outside of your faction.
* Prevents villagers from being hurt by people outside of your faction.

Each protection can be disable individually.

# Commands
The only command right now is **/fgreload** to reload the configuration from disk.
You need to have permissions to **fg.reload** to use it.
